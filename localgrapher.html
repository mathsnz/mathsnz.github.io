<b>NZGrapher Locally Hosted</b><br>
You can download the files for NZGrapher from <a target='_blank' href="http://www.jake4maths.com/grapher.zip" target="_blank">http://www.jake4maths.com/grapher.zip</a><br>
You will need to extract them into a folder on a web server running PHP (with the GD library enabled).<br>
<br>
Full details are inside the README file.<br>
Once you have it up and running can you please let me know what the address for it is so I can have it for my records.<br>
<br>
If you wish to be emailed when updates are released please <a href='./contact.html'>email me</a>.<br>
If you have any questions don't hesitate to get in touch and I'll see if I can get the problem fixed for you.<br>
<br>
And if you're not already signed up... you can sign up for my newsletter here: <a href='http://eepurl.com/4JD3v'>http://eepurl.com/4JD3v</a><br>
I'll only send you emails every once and a while when there are new features or I have something else exciting to tell you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Custom Folders</b><br>
Teachers can upload files into the foldertemplate folder (which you can rename to whatever you would like by just changing the name of the folder directly on the server... or copy it as many times as you would like) and then teachers can access it and add files by going to http://url-to-access-nzgrapher/foldertemplate/<br>
The password for this folder is inside a file in the folder.<br>
Students can then access the data in that folder by going to http://url-to-access-nzgrapher/?folder=foldertemplate<br>
Many schools have multiple folders going (level1, level2, level3 etc)<br>
If you have any questions don't hesitate to <a href='./contact.html'>email me</a>.<br>
