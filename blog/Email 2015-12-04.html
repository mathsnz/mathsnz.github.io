<b>General Updates</b><img src='https://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/12106906_886599664762559_6034109619279458886_n.jpg?oh=3464fc21135219f0be28204abeec0bf0&oe=56F57BB5' style='float:right;width:250px;border:none;margin-left:15px;'><br>
Firstly, appologies about not doing as much as I normally would have been doing, I got married 2 months ago yesterday, so that has occupied quite a lot of my time this year, which means I haven't been able to do as much as I would have liked, and some of the resources I wanted to be able to work on I haven't had the time to put into making them.... there are lots more things coming next year. <br>
<br>
I encourage you to like my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mathsnz" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>facebook page</a> to keep up to date on a more regular basis than these emails.<br>
<br>
<b>MathsNZ Updates</b><br>
I've re-vamped the <a href='https://www.mathsnz.com/'>MathsNZ</a> website to make it easier to find everything, and also updated many of the booklets on there to reflect recent changes in NZGrapher... the biggest change with this has been in time series.<br>
<br>
<b>MathsNZ Students Updates</b><img src='https://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/12189659_896879063734619_2892073632392977966_n.jpg?oh=942d90208e0e5bde89f50d03e0aafb50&oe=56D9ABED' style='float:right;width:250px;border:none;margin-left:15px;'><br>
Recently I also totally re-vamped the <a href='https://students.mathsnz.com/'>MathsNZ Students</a> website to make it easier for students to find what they are after, and make it easier for me to add more resources onto the website.<br>
<br>
Students can now view typed notes as well as video lessons, but as part of this the tracking of activities where students could keep track of what activities they had done has been removed as it was not really being used anyway.<br>
<br>
There are also no more ads on any of the videos... I hated them, and they didn't really make me any money, despite lost of people viewing the videos, so I've removed all the ads, so you can watch the videos without any interference.<br>
<br>
<b>MathsNZ Question Generator</b><img src='https://scontent-syd1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/12107095_886516068104252_7782892334153478786_n.png?oh=bc4f4b86817c0dab8447737aa576db10&oe=56F15C81' style='float:right;width:250px;border:none;margin-left:15px;'><br>
MathsNZ Question Generator is a free tool to generate an endless stream of maths questions... new question types are being added regularly, so if you have a good idea please let me know.<br>
<br>
I've recently done a big update to MathsNZ Question Generator... you can now order questions however you want. Check it out at <a href='https://www.jake4maths.com/generator'>jake4maths.com/generator</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<b>NZGrapher Updates</b><img src='https://fbcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xlf1/v/t1.0-0/s480x480/12019908_877565475665978_1763567020977662730_n.png?oh=8f212c6f28e1101c45f88703502a0fbe&oe=56F116F3&__gda__=1458410612_4efa675daee82bb6f48451a700c01397' style='float:right;width:250px;border:none;margin-left:15px;'><br>
A whole bunch of changes have been made in the last few months:
<ul>
  <li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
  <li>Points are now easier to see on most graphs, and the colours now go through the whole rainbow rather than just red to green.</li>
  <li>You can bootstrap single variables (see picture to the right)</li>
  <li>Time series now allows you to choose between multiplicative and additive models</li>
  <li>Added ability to create a new calculated column (under "Sample and More").</li>
  <li>Blank / non-numerical points in re-randomisation and bootstraps are no longer plotted.</li>
  <li>Changed the data menu to be able to more easily find functions.</li>
</ul>
As always, if you have feedback I always appreciate getting it... all these ideas are based off suggestions that have come through from other teachers.<br>
Access NZGrapher here: <a href='https://www.jake4maths.com/grapher'>jake4maths.com/grapher</a> and more details on NZGrapher can be found on <a href='http://www.mathsnz.com/nzgrapher.html'>MathsNZ</a> and video tutorials on <a href='http://students.mathsnz.com/'>MathsNZ Students</a><br>
<br>
<b>NZGrapher Speeds</b><br>
Also, just a reminder, to help combat speed issues, if your school would like to host NZGrapher on-site
(just for your own school's use, or shared with others if you want) please send me an email and we can sort this out. (You'll need to talk
to your IT person and will need a web server that supports PHP, most schools are likely to have this).
We currently have a number of schools doing this and they are finding it much faster.<br>

<b>Facebook Page</b><br>
I have set up a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mathsnz" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>facebook page</a> where I post updates on a more
regular basis. If you want to be the first to find out about new resources and upcoming updates you can like
the page, as I try to limit these emails to only a couple per term.<br>
<br>
<b>Assay</b><br>
I have also developed another tool for analysing student data called assay. This is the only thing I do that I ask for money for (but not much - and everything else is free). You can check it out at <a href='http://assay.co.nz'>assay.co.nz</a><br>

As always, (almost) all of these resources are provided free of charge... but donations are gladly accepted,
thanks to those of you who have already donated. Full details on how to donate are available here:
<a href="https://www.mathsnz.com/donate.html" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>https://www.mathsnz.com/donate.html</a><br>
<br>
As always, if you have feedback or suggestions please let me know.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
