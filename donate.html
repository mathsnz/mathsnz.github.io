I am a Maths teacher at a large school in New Zealand. This site has been set up in my own time to 
support maths teachers in NZ. The aim of the site is to provide resources and guides for teachers 
and students. All of these resources are provided free of charge... 
but <a href='./donations.html'>donations</a> are gladly accepted.<br>
