	<li>Louise Towers ran sessions for middle school students in the UK. This is what she had to say about these resources:<br>
	<br>
	<i>We decided to do something based on geometry because of the differing backgrounds. As you can see its not IT based. 
	Partly a sign of the times when we did it, but also I think its good to have something to take home to show and talk about to family.<br><br>	
	We were also not in our classrooms but in a Middle School room with students from different schools and so with differing backgrounds.  
	I haven't changed anything recently - I see a reference to OHP!!!!!!<br><br>
	None of the activities are new - anyone who has been around a few years will know them - all I have done is type them up.<br><br>
	For the tangram the students started with the square and the instructions were read aloud - they had to listen and mark on their blank square.</i>
